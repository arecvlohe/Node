# Simple Node Server

This is a simple node server that retrieves information from an API endpoint ([OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org)) and loads to the browser at localhost:5000.

To run the program, clone the repo to your desktop and run `$ node _index.js` in your terminal. Then open your browser and go to localhost:5000 and you should see the current temperature for Tampa, FL.

Let me know how I might be able to do thise better!
