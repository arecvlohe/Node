# Simple Node Server

This is a simple node server that retrieves information from an API endpoint ([OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org)) and loads to the browser at localhost:5000.

To run the program, clone the repo to your desktop and run `$ node _index.js` in your terminal. Then open your browser and go to localhost:5000 and you should see the current temperature for Tampa, FL.

P.S. I am not, nor do I claim to be, an experienced JavaScript developer. This implementation is neither the most fundamentally sound nor the best implementation of the concept. I am just sharing my work with the world and am listening to any helpful critiques that propel me to be better at what I do.
